    <h1>Advent Calendar</h1>
    <p>
      My trusted helper, Cat Penelope (Pepe), is here to assist with opening
      today’s door. And by "assist," I mean she’s strategically placed her paw
      to block the number 8, knocked the chocolate off the table, and claimed
      the entire calendar as her new throne. Who needs a chocolate treat when
      you have a furry chaos manager reminding you that the real gift of the
      season is patience?
